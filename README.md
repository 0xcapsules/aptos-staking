# Permissionless Stake Pool by OpenRails

## Aptos Validator Model

The Aptos validator model only supports one validator per stake pool (the account address where APT accrues). As a result, it is 
currently impossible for multiple people to deposit their coins into a stake pool and begin to receive yield. This module
provides a means of circumventing that, by creating a permissionless stake pool where anyone can deposit their APT and
begin to receive yield while securing the network. The OpenRails team is currently building two modules pertaining to
staking, and they are the following:

### N owners : 1 stake pool
That's this! With multiple people able to freely stake with a single validator, validators can opt to decentralize the
network by allowing anyone to perimissionlessly stake with them, similar to how one would do so in other PoS chains.

### 1 owner : N stake pools
Coming soon ðŸ‘€ Things are getting pretty _liquid_...
